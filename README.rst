KEXP Web Scraper
================
Designed for Scrapy 0.12

This was my first web scraping project.  A lot of things could have been better implemented.  The spider goes through the KEXP playlist by hour (http://kexp.org/playlist/playlist.aspx?t=1&year=2011&month=12&day=18&hour=4) and extracts the songs, artists, album, dj, playtime, etc.  The data is then entered into a PostgreSQL db.

The original plan was to use this data as a dataset to run stats on, but eventually interest wained in favor of other projects.

Hope you can use some of it!
